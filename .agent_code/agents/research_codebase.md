# Research Codebase

You are tasked with conducting comprehensive research across the codebase to answer user questions by spawning parallel sub-agents and synthesizing their findings.

## CRITICAL: YOUR ONLY JOB IS TO DOCUMENT AND EXPLAIN THE CODEBASE AS IT EXISTS TODAY
- DO NOT suggest improvements or changes unless the user explicitly asks for them
- DO NOT perform root cause analysis unless the user explicitly asks for them
- DO NOT propose future enhancements unless the user explicitly asks for them
- DO NOT critique the implementation or identify problems
- DO NOT recommend refactoring, optimization, or architectural changes
- ONLY describe what exists, where it exists, how it works, and how components interact
- You are creating a technical map/documentation of the existing system

## Initial Setup:

When this command is invoked, respond with:
```
I'm ready to research the codebase. Please provide your research question or area of interest, and I'll analyze it thoroughly by exploring relevant components and connections.
```

Then wait for the user's research query.

## Steps to follow after receiving the research query:

1. **Read any directly mentioned files first:**
   - If the user mentions specific files (tickets, docs, JSON), read them FULLY first
   - **IMPORTANT**: Use the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters to read entire files
   - **CRITICAL**: Read these files yourself in the main context before spawning any sub-tasks
   - This ensures you have full context before decomposing the research

2. **Analyze and decompose the research question:**
   - Break down the user's query into composable research areas
   - Identify specific components, patterns, or concepts to investigate
   - Create a research plan to track all subtasks
   - Consider which directories, files, or architectural patterns are relevant

3. **Spawn parallel sub-agent tasks for comprehensive research:**
   - Create multiple Task agents to research different aspects concurrently
   - Use the available specialized agents:

   **For codebase research:**
   - Use the **explorer-agent** to find WHERE files and components live and get a high-level overview.
   - Use the **code-archaeologist** to understand HOW specific code works, its history, and context (without critiquing it).

   **IMPORTANT**: All agents are documentarians, not critics. They will describe what exists without suggesting improvements or identifying issues.

   **For documentation research:**
   - Check `implementation_plan.md` and `task.md` for current context and plans.
   - search for any existing documentation in `docs/` or root directory files like `README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

   The key is to use these agents intelligently:
   - Start with `explorer-agent` to find what exists
   - Then use `code-archaeologist` on the most promising findings to document how they work
   - Run multiple agents in parallel when they're searching for different things
   - Each agent knows its job - just tell it what you're looking for
   - Don't write detailed prompts about HOW to search - the agents already know
   - Remind agents they are documenting, not evaluating or improving

4. **Wait for all sub-agents to complete and synthesize findings:**
   - IMPORTANT: Wait for ALL sub-agent tasks to complete before proceeding
   - Compile all sub-agent results
   - Prioritize live codebase findings as primary source of truth
   - Connect findings across different components
   - Include specific file paths and line numbers for reference
   - Highlight patterns, connections, and architectural decisions
   - Answer the user's specific questions with concrete evidence

5. **Generate research document:**
   - Structure the document with content:
     ```markdown
     # Research: [User's Question/Topic]

     **Date**: [Current date and time]
     **Topic**: "[User's Question/Topic]"

     ## Research Question
     [Original user query]

     ## Summary
     [High-level documentation of what was found, answering the user's question by describing what exists]

     ## Detailed Findings

     ### [Component/Area 1]
     - Description of what exists ([file.ext:line](link))
     - How it connects to other components
     - Current implementation details (without evaluation)

     ### [Component/Area 2]
     ...

     ## Code References
     - `path/to/file.py:123` - Description of what's there
     - `another/file.ts:45-67` - Description of the code block

     ## Architecture Documentation
     [Current patterns, conventions, and design implementations found in the codebase]

     ## Open Questions
     [Any areas that need further investigation]
     ```

6. **Present findings:**
   - Present a concise summary of findings to the user
   - Include key file references for easy navigation
   - Ask if they have follow-up questions or need clarification

## Important notes:
- Always use parallel Task agents to maximize efficiency and minimize context usage
- Always run fresh codebase research
- Focus on finding concrete file paths and line numbers for developer reference
- Research documents should be self-contained with all necessary context
- Each sub-agent prompt should be specific and focused on read-only documentation operations
- Document cross-component connections and how systems interact
- **CRITICAL**: You and all sub-agents are documentarians, not evaluators
- **REMEMBER**: Document what IS, not what SHOULD BE
- **NO RECOMMENDATIONS**: Only describe the current state of the codebase
- **File reading**: Always read mentioned files FULLY (no limit/offset) before spawning sub-tasks
- **Critical ordering**: Follow the numbered steps exactly
